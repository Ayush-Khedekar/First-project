            5G refers to the fifth generation of mobile network technology,
            along with speed, low latency, and high capacity. It enables
            seamless connectivity with devices and applications. It will drive
            the future of IoT, AR/VR, smart cities, and other nascent
            innovations that, by and large, need the underwater infrastructure
            capability for the conduction of business such as autonomous
